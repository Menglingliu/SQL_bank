We have two tables: user_table and price_snapshot

User_table: User id | create_date
Price_snapshot: User id | price | snapshot_date

Question: % Users who had pricing change within one week of creation?

WITH price_changes AS ( 
SELECT 
      p.user_id, 
      MIN(p.snapshot_date) AS first_snapshot_date, 
      MAX(p.price) - MIN(p.price) AS price_diff 
FROM price_snapshot p 
JOIN user_table u 
ON p.user_id = u.user_id 
WHERE p.snapshot_date BETWEEN u.create_date AND u.create_date + INTERVAL '7 days' GROUP BY p.user_id 
) 

SELECT 
     COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN price_diff <> 0 THEN user_id END) * 100.0 / COUNT(DISTINCT u.user_id) AS percentage_users_with_price_change 
FROM user_table u 
LEFT JOIN price_changes pc 
ON u.user_id = pc.user_id
